# Mathable Automatic Scoring

## Description

The projectâ€™s aim is to automatically count the score of the Mathable game using Computer Vision and image processing techniques.

### Required Libraries

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- Numpy: For numerical operations
- opencv-python (cv2): For image processing and computer vision tasks
- Pillow (PIL): For image file operations outside the purview of OpenCV

You can install these libraries using pip with the following command:
!pip install opencv-contrib-python
!pip install pillow

#### Solution

The Jupyter Notebook file should be opened inside the folder containing 'board+tokens' folder with images, and also the alligned image 'tokens7_alligned_2.jpg'.
A new folder 'oriented_tokens_2' will be created and it will contain reference tokens that will be used for matching template.
The txt files will be saved in '407_Nicolae_Alexandra_Cristina' folder containing games' positions, elements and final score.
